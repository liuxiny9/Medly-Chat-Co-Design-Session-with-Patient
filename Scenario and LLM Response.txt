Scenarios    Medly Chat Prototype Response

I had a rough night yesterday. My legs were very swollen, and I could not fall asleep. I had to move very slowly and needed my family's support to go downstairs to take breakfast and my medications. What should I do? (Theme: Symptom Follow-Up​)    I am really sorry to hear that you had such a tough night. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's okay to feel worried. Swollen legs and difficulty moving can be signs that your body is holding onto too much fluid, which can happen with heart failure.
 Here's what you can do right now:
 1. Call Your Healthcare Team Right Away: Swelling and trouble sleeping could mean your heart failure symptoms are worsening. Contact your doctor, nurse, or Medly Coordinator as soon as possible to let them know how you're feeling. They may need to adjust your medications, like diuretics (water pills), to help your body get rid of the extra fluid.
 2. Check Your Weight: If you can, weigh yourself and write it down. A sudden weight gain (like 2–3 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in a week) can be a sign of fluid buildup. Share this information with your care team when you speak to them.
 3. Elevate Your Legs: When you're sitting or lying down, try to raise your legs above the level of your heart. This can help reduce swelling. You can use pillows to prop them up comfortably.
 4. Rest and Take It Slow: It's okay to lean on your family for support when you're feeling this way. Rest as much as you need, and don't push yourself too hard. Your body is asking for a break.
 5. Follow Your Fluid and Salt Guidelines: If your doctor has given you limits on how much fluid or salt you can have, stick to those as closely as you can. Too much salt or fluid can make swelling worse.
 A Quick Tip:
Think of your body like a balloon. If there's too much water inside, it can feel tight and heavy. Your care team can help "let out some air" by adjusting your treatment, so don't hesitate to reach out to them.
 You're doing the right thing by noticing these symptoms and asking for help. It's not easy, but you're taking steps to take care of yourself, and that's what matters most. Keep going — you're stronger than you think!
 Medly Alert:
I noticed you have an active yellow alert to follow your healthcare provider's orders to take your medication, contact your Medly care team, and go to the emergency department if you feel very unwell. Please make sure to prioritize and follow your alert's instructions (except when otherwise stated by your healthcare team), and to continue taking your readings in Medly.

I have a question about bisoprolol. The Medly Coordinator (nurse) called yesterday to change my dose from 2.5 mg to 5 mg, but I still have some pills left on my last dose. Should I wait until my next pack, or do I go to the pharmacy now? (Theme: Management of Medications & Prescriptions​)    That's a great question, and I'm glad you're being careful about your medication. When your dose of bisoprolol changes, it's important to start the new dose as soon as possible, as this medication helps your heart work more efficiently and manage symptoms like breathlessness.
 Here's what you can do:
1. Check the Pharmacy First: Call your pharmacy to see if they can provide the new 5 mg dose right away. Pharmacies are often prepared for dose changes, especially if the Medly Coordinator has already contacted them.
 2. Don't Adjust the Dose Yourself: If you still have 2.5 mg pills left, don't take two of them to make 5 mg unless your healthcare provider has specifically told you to do so. Always follow their instructions.
 3. If You Can't Get the New Dose Immediately: If there's a delay in getting your new pills, stay on your current dose (2.5 mg) until you can pick up the 5 mg tablets. It's better to take the lower dose than to skip doses altogether.
 4. Keep Communication Open: If you're unsure or have any concerns, don't hesitate to call your Medly Coordinator or pharmacist for clarification. They're there to help you through situations like this.
 Quick Tip:
Think of your medications like a recipe for your heart health. Every ingredient (dose) matters, so it's best to follow the recipe exactly as it's given to you.
 You're doing the right thing by asking this question — it shows you're taking charge of your health. Keep up the great work!

That's another day of just sitting around. I used to be able to fix anything around the house. Now I get breathless walking to the mailbox. It's frustrating. (Theme: Symptom Follow-Up​ with potential signal of mental health needs)    I hear you, and I can only imagine how hard it must be to feel like you can't do the things you used to. It's okay to feel frustrated — it's a normal reaction when your body isn't cooperating the way you want it to. But please remember, you're not alone in this, and there are still ways to feel accomplished and find joy, even with these challenges.
 Let's focus on what you can do:
1. Start Small, Celebrate Big: Even small activities, like folding laundry, watering plants, or organizing a drawer, can give you a sense of purpose. These tasks may not feel the same as fixing things around the house, but they still matter.
 2. Pace Yourself: It's okay to take breaks. If walking to the mailbox feels like a marathon, break it into smaller steps. For example, walk halfway, rest, and then continue. Over time, your stamina may improve.
 3. Stay Active Safely: Gentle exercises, like seated stretches or light walking indoors, can help you maintain strength without overdoing it. If you're not sure where to start, a cardiac rehabilitation program could guide you in building up your activity level safely.
 4. Adapt and Adjust: If fixing things is something you love, maybe you can work on smaller projects that don't require as much physical effort. For example, you could work on a hobby like tinkering with small electronics or doing light repairs while sitting.
 5. Focus on Your Wins: It's easy to dwell on what you can't do, but try to shift your focus to the things you are managing. Did you get out of bed today? Did you take your medications? Did you reach out for support? Each of these is a victory.
 A Helpful Analogy:
Think of yourself as a phone battery that doesn't hold a full charge anymore. You might not be able to run every app at once, but with careful use, you can still get the most important things done.
 It's okay to mourn the changes in your life, but don't lose sight of the fact that you're still you. Your skills, your love for your family, and the pride you take in your home are still there. You're adapting, and that takes courage. Keep going — you're doing better than you think!
